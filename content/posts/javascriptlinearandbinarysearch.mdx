> According to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

JavaScript comes with a number of methods to be used on arrays. These methods i.e sort and map are more sophisticated implementations of the algorithms we will look at so feel free to dive deeper into the topic. 

### Searching

Searching means iterating over the elements of an array in order to retrieve data from it.
When it comes to arrays there are different techniques for searching depending on whether the array is sorted or not.

1. Linear Search- for both sorted and none sorted arrays.
2. Binary Search- for sorted arrays.

### Linear Search

An example for an implementation of linear search is shown below:



`const names = [ "Thomas", "Antony", "Lisa", "Loice" ]`

`function linearSearch (array, n) {`

`    for (let index = 0; i < array.length; i++) {`

`        if ( array[index] == n ) {`

`            return array[index]`

`        }`

`    }`

`    return false`

`}`

`console.log(linearSearch(names, "Lisa"))`

We define a function linearSearch which takes in an array and the name we want to search as its arguments. If the name is found, we return it's index in the array.

When the function linearSearch is called, the array is sequentially iterated, from array\[0] up to array\[n] where n is 3 in this case(we always count from zero). The function will return immeditely it finds an array element where the value of the element is equal to the provided search term, otherwise it will eventually return false after breeaking out of the for loop.

The time complexity for a linear search algorithm is O(n) in the worst case. What this means is that we have to go through every single element to know whether our search term is present, for example if we had an array with a million names and we had to find a specific one.

We can use a linear search when we have an array of unsorted data because when the data is sorted a binary search will be faster. Let's talk about binary search next.

**Binary Search**


A binary search works by cutting an array in half at a middle value and checking whether the value being searched for is greater than the middle value. If it is less than the middle value, the search only continues in the lower half, but if it is more, the search happens in the upper half. This is repeated until either the value is found or the array elements are exhausted.

An example of a binary search in the matrix clould be like using a dictionary. Dictionaries are sorted alphabetically. This means that if we want to find a word, for example tomato, we don't have to check every single word in the dictionary. It would be slow, redundant and just painful. We can search for the word tomato by following these steps: 

1. Set the high and lowest possible word values i.e last and first word in the dictionary.

2. Check for the word in the middle of the high and low values.

3. Compare it to tomato. If it is equal, return. If it is alphabetically after tomato set the high value to be equal to the current middle value and go to 2. If it is before tomato, set the low value to be equal to the current middle value and go to 2.

An implementation for a binary search is shown below:

```javascript
function binarySearch(array, n) {
	let lowIndex = 0, highIndex = array.length-1

	while(lowIndex <= highIndex) {
		let midIndex = Math.floor((lowIndex + highIndex) / 2)
		if (array[midIndex] == n) {
			return midIndex
		} else if (n > array[midIndex]) {
			lowIndex = midIndex
		} else {
			highIndex = midIndex
		}
	}
	return 0
}
```

}

As seen in the example, the algorithm keeps dividing the array into two halves and comparing until a solution is found.
